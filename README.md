Project #2: Building Your First Full-stack Application

Inspired by Reddit, I decided to build my own interactive knowledge exchange platform - a mini-Reddit clone. The platform will require users to register before they can view the content while users are also encouraged to share more information regarding their expertise.

## Getting Started

git clone https://github.com/olico852/wdi-project2.git


### Prerequisites


### How to Use

npm install

Users must register before they are able to view content within. They are also able to create and edit posts and comments.

## Workflow

Did you write user stories, draw wireframes, use task tracking, produce ERDs? Did you use source control, with regular commits? Include links to them here.

User Stories:
As a user, I would like to be part of a semi-open community where I can contribute information to while consuming quality knowledge. I would like to easily keep track of posts and comments I've shared.

As a developer, I wanted to ensure that the cumulative and open knowledge within the community can be easily accessed. I wanted to provide an indicator of credibility based on each user's unique background. The barrier to entry is deliberately set low - users merely need to create an account and their email addresses exist for account ownership rather than retrieval of their personal data.  

Wireframes were drawn and that helped in prioritizing features and functionality that were core for the app to work.

Task tracking was done using Trello while source control was done on github.
